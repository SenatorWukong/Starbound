  <p>Starbound was advertised as a succesor and improvement upon Terraria, one of the best selling games 
  of all time. However, given that you've likely never heard of it, this dream did not go through. Funded 
  and released, but the fame expected and glamour was not granted. Starbound lacked part of what made Terraria 
  so iconic and memorable. But what it does have Terraria cannot even light a candle to. </p>

<p> The biggest difference between the two is Starbound is a high space sci-fi adventure. Dealing 
  with a galaxy thousands of years ahead of our own, where humanity isn't alone in the universe. They 
  collaborate and fight with the Simian like Apex, the aquatic Hylotls, the brutish Florian, the ancient Avian, 
  the regressive Glitch, and the mysterious Novakids. All having thier own cultures, homeworlds, legends, settlements. 
  And this is reflected in the players ship, which varies based on what race they chose at the beggining. While 
 this is a superficial difference ultimatley, it is apart of Starbounds's greatest strengths, flavour.</p>

<p>The monsters you as the player face vary heavily! From the silly penguin general, to the malignant stain on the
   world that is the final boss and antagonist. This variation is remiscent of Terraria. But. Unlike it, 
   this mish mash, while interesting, does not serve it well.</p>

   <p> PLACER IMAGE OF ONE OF STARBOUNDS GENERATED WORLDS
So much of Starbound's exploration is based around uniquely generated planets. Differing terrain, new monsters
potential settlements to discover and claim, and so much more. Compared to Terraria's own generation, it seems so much
more open ended and fantastical, and yet... Yet Starbound feels more samey. The generation is not as advanced as the 
game lets on, but in exchange, no matter how repeated the monsters may be, the music, the sounds of the world, all come 
together to make it feel alien. The true variation in Starbound's planets are the need for eqipment and resources avilable
as well as the odd super dungeon on occasion. Most of the story takes place not on these randomized worlds, but sanatized 
instances you get to via the inship teleporter. 
PLACER IMAGE OF THE STORY AREA - HYLOTL LIBRARY
And what the game lacks in overall generation, its story dungeons are to die for. Scenic, beautiful, and so grand in scope
it can make you feel so helplessly small. The Hylotl library is the greatest example to me. Building on what the player has 
no doubt enountered on the oceanic worlds of the galaxy, to make this sprawling domain of ruined learning and desolate deep 
Sea terror.</p>
